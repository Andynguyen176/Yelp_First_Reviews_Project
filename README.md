# Yelp_First_Reviews_Project

In this project, I was introduced to the world of data analysis on a deeper level. On a deeper level in terms of data cleansing and profiling.
The purpose of this project was to put everything we've learned in big data to create a story for our question. 
I had the opportunity to work with 3 other great classmates to create this project. 
We ran everything through IBM Watson using Spark SQL, Python, and Tableau. 

The question's we want answered: 
  * Are users first review higher or lower than their average over time?
  * Is this different for users who are elite?
  * What is the distribution of rating for first review?
  
Enjoy. The story lies within the data.
